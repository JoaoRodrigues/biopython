Assorted utility functions to manipulate structural data.

This module serves as a container for all structural manipulation
utilities that used to belong in the structure objects themselves.

Functions should take as argument a collection of objects, or those
that can be unfolded in children (Structure, Chain, ...)
The output should be an equivalent data structure.

The module should also be callable directly to allow straightforward
manipulation in a shell enviroment.
